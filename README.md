# 🎮 Java Text-Based RPG

## 📌 Overview
A simple **terminal-based role-playing game** built in Java for our **Object-Oriented Programming 1 (OOP1)** subject.  
This is our **final project** for OOP1, started on **September 16, 2025** and **still ongoing**.  
The game demonstrates **OOP concepts** such as classes, objects, inheritance, and modular design.

⚠ **Note:** This project is in its **very early development stage**.  
It is **not ready to run or play yet** — core systems and features are still being built.

## 🕹 Planned Features
- Start menu (Start Game/Exit)
- Player creation
- Turn-based combat
- Basic exploration
- Expandable storyline

---

## 📝 Core Concepts Game Ideas 
- Currency: Shards
- Valuable Item: Crystals — used for crafting and reviving characters
- Reviving Mechanic: Requires a specific amount of Crystals
- Enemies (Mobs): Called Fractures
- Core Crafting System:
- Normal Item + Crystals = Special Item
    Example: Pencil + Crystals = Pencil Blade
- Mini Bosses: Mascot-themed Fractures
    Example: JoliBeast = Fractured Jolibee

## 🛠 How to Run (For Later)
Once the game reaches a runnable state, you will be able to compile and run it from the project root:
```bash
# Compile
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")

# Run
java -cp out rpg.Main

# Or
We will just make it an executable

```
